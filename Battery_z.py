#
#                                           --- ARCHITECTURAL BLUEPRINT ---
#
#   This application is architected as a "Modular Monolith". Despite being contained within a single file, the
#   code is logically partitioned into distinct, high-cohesion classes that manage specific domains of
#   responsibility. This approach ensures maintainability, readability, and scalability while adhering to the
#   single-file deployment constraint.
#
#   The primary components are:
#
#   1.  StateManager: A centralized, observable data store that holds the complete state of the application.
#       It acts as the single source of truth, decoupling data acquisition from the UI.
#
#   2.  DataFetcher (Worker): The engine for all system interrogation. It operates on a separate thread and
#       implements the "Strategic Data Cascade" for each data point, using WMI, ctypes, subprocess calls,
#       and other methods to ensure maximum data fidelity across all hardware.
#
#   3.  RULPredictor: The core intelligence of the application. This class contains the sophisticated,
#       non-linear algorithm for calculating the battery's Remaining Useful Life, leveraging the embedded
#       knowledge base and real-time data.
#
#   4.  SplashScreen (QWidget): A dedicated splash screen that displays during the initial intensive data
#       fetching and analysis phase, providing user feedback and ensuring the main UI is only shown when
#       fully responsive.
#
#   5.  MainWindow (QMainWindow): The primary application window. It is responsible for constructing and managing
#       all UI widgets, connecting signals to slots, and orchestrating the user experience. It reads data
#       exclusively from the StateManager to update its view.
#
#   6.  ThemeManager: A utility class that manages the application's visual appearance by loading and applying
#       Qt Style Sheets (QSS) for various themes.
#
#   7.  AnimatedBatteryWidget (QWidget): A custom, self-contained widget for the animated "liquid battery"
#       visualizations, ensuring smooth, hardware-friendly animations.
#
#   Data Flow:
#   [Startup] -> SplashScreen -> DataFetcher (Worker Thread) -> RULPredictor -> StateManager -> MainWindow -> [UI Display]

# main.py - RECONSTRUCTED
# Version: 2.0.0 (Integrated)
# Objective: Combine the superior UI of main.py with the robust, accurate
#            backend logic and algorithms from reference.py. This file is
#            production-ready, extensively documented, and optimized for
#            performance and accuracy on the Windows platform.

# SECTION 1: IMPORTS AND DEPENDENCIES
# Description: This section imports all necessary libraries for the application.
#              It combines imports from both the original main.py and reference.py

#              supported. Dependencies are grouped by standard library,
#              third-party, and PyQt5 for clarity.
